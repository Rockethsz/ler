            <p><strong>Question 18: Angus Draper, CFA, is a senior portfolio manager and member of the investment
                                    committee at Tillahook Investments. Draper serves as a board member for
                                    several non-profit organizations. These commitments require eight workdays per
                                    month of Draper’s time. Because he does not receive any form of compensation
                                    for these activities, Draper does not tell anyone at work about his board activities.
                                    Does Draper violate any CFA Institute Standards?  </strong></p>
